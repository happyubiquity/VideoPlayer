00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.609
克里斯•安德森：有件事情很奇怪。Chris Anderson: This is such a strange thing.

3
00:00:15.609 --> 00:00:18.856
你的软件，Linux，运行于数百万计算机中，
Your software, Linux, is in millions of computers,

4
00:00:18.856 --> 00:00:22.417
可以说是它驱动了网络。
it probably powers much of the Internet.

5
00:00:22.417 --> 00:00:24.204
我想，全世界正在使用
And I think that there are, like,

6
00:00:24.204 --> 00:00:27.594
将近15亿台的安卓设备。
a billion and a half active Android devices out there.

7
00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:30.807
每一台里都有你的软件。
Your software is in every single one of them.

8
00:00:30.807 --> 00:00:31.987
这非常了不起。
It's kind of amazing.

9
00:00:31.987 --> 00:00:37.067
你肯定有一个特别高大上的总部来实现这一切。
You must have some amazing software headquarters driving all this.

10
00:00:37.067 --> 00:00:40.387
我以前真这么想—— 直到我看到这张照片，我被震惊了。
That's what I thought -- and I was shocked when I saw a picture of it.

11
00:00:40.387 --> 00:00:41.610
真的惊了——
I mean, this is --

12
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.965
这就是Linux的总部。
this is the Linux world headquarters.

13
00:00:43.965 --> 00:00:45.908
（笑声）
(Laughter)

14
00:00:45.908 --> 00:00:49.912
（掌声）
(Applause)

15
00:00:49.912 --> 00:00:52.228
林纳斯•托瓦兹：好吧，让大家失望了。
Linus Torvalds: It really doesn't look like much.

16
00:00:52.228 --> 00:00:53.929
我不得不说，
And I have to say,

17
00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.773
这张照片里最有意思的地方，
the most interesting part in this picture,

18
00:00:57.773 --> 00:00:59.509
被最多人问起的地方，
that people mostly react to,

19
00:00:59.509 --> 00:01:00.996
就是那张会动的办公桌。
is the walking desk.

20
00:01:00.996 --> 00:01:03.700
这是我办公室最有趣的部分
It is the most interesting part in my office

21
00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.713
虽然我现在不怎么用它了。
and I'm not actually using it anymore.

22
00:01:05.713 --> 00:01:09.206
我觉得两者是有联系的。
And I think the two things are related.

23
00:01:09.206 --> 00:01:13.245
我的工作方式……
The way I work is ...

24
00:01:13.245 --> 00:01:18.170
我不想要有太多的外来刺激。
I want to not have external stimulation.

25
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:23.477
大家能看到，我的墙是淡绿色的。
You can kind of see, on the walls are this light green.

26
00:01:23.477 --> 00:01:27.948
据说精神病医院的墙就是这种颜色。
I'm told that at mental institutions they use that on the walls.

27
00:01:27.948 --> 00:01:29.025
（笑声）
(Laughter)

28
00:01:29.025 --> 00:01:30.844
这种颜色能让你平静，
It's like a calming color,

29
00:01:30.844 --> 00:01:35.063
不会刺激到你。
it's not something that really stimulates you.

30
00:01:35.063 --> 00:01:39.519
其实大家看不到我的电脑（主机），只能看到显示器，
What you can't see is the computer here, you only see the screen,

31
00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:42.933
我对电脑最主要的要求——
but the main thing I worry about in my computer is --

32
00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:46.283
并不是性能强劲，尽管我也爱——
it doesn't have to be big and powerful, although I like that --

33
00:01:46.283 --> 00:01:49.974
就是它必须没有任何声音。
it really has to be completely silent.

34
00:01:49.974 --> 00:01:52.046
我认识一些在谷歌工作的人，
I know people who work for Google

35
00:01:52.046 --> 00:01:55.257
他们在家里都有小型数据中心，
and they have their own small data center at home,

36
00:01:55.257 --> 00:01:56.433
我可没这习惯。
and I don't do that.

37
00:01:56.433 --> 00:02:00.152
我的办公室也许是你见过最无聊的一个。
My office is the most boring office you'll ever see.

38
00:02:00.152 --> 00:02:04.140
我喜欢独自一人，享受安静。
And I sit there alone in the quiet.

39
00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.222
如果有猫进来，
If the cat comes up,

40
00:02:06.222 --> 00:02:08.063
它会坐在我大腿上。
it sits in my lap.

41
00:02:08.063 --> 00:02:10.298
我喜欢听猫打呼噜，
And I want to hear the cat purring,

42
00:02:10.298 --> 00:02:13.475
而不是听特烦的电脑风扇的声音。
not the sound of the fans in the computer.

43
00:02:13.475 --> 00:02:14.818
CA：太了不起了，
CA: So this is astonishing,

44
00:02:14.818 --> 00:02:17.531
你的这种工作方式，
because working this way,

45
00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:20.522
才能让你运行如此庞大的一个技术帝国——
you're able to run this vast technology empire --

46
00:02:20.522 --> 00:02:21.777
确实是一个帝国——it is an empire --

47
00:02:21.777 --> 00:02:25.502
这是开源（软件）强大力量的一个最好例证。
so that's an amazing testament to the power of open source.

48
00:02:25.502 --> 00:02:29.991
请告诉我们你是如何理解开源的，
Tell us how you got to understand open source

49
00:02:29.991 --> 00:02:33.545
和它又是如何一步一步发展成Linux的。
and how it lead to the development of Linux.

50
00:02:33.545 --> 00:02:35.080
LT：我现在还是独自工作。
LT: I mean, I still work alone.

51
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.692
真的，我独自一人在家工作，
Really -- I work alone in my house,

52
00:02:38.692 --> 00:02:40.086
经常穿着浴袍干活。
often in my bathrobe.

53
00:02:40.086 --> 00:02:42.670
当一个摄影师来的时候，我才会穿戴整齐，
When a photographer shows up, I dress up,

54
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.980
所以（这张照片里）我是穿着衣服的。
so I have clothes on.

55
00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.252
（笑声）
(Laughter)

56
00:02:45.252 --> 00:02:47.348
我一直以来就是这样工作的。
And that's how I've always worked.

57
00:02:47.348 --> 00:02:49.370
Linux也是这样诞生的。
I mean, this was how I started Linux, too.

58
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.052
Linux并不是一个合作的产物。
I did not start Linux as a collaborative project.

59
00:02:53.052 --> 00:02:57.944
它是我一系列项目中的一个，
I started it as one in a series of many projects

60
00:02:57.944 --> 00:03:01.919
纯粹出于自己当时的需要，
I had done at the time for myself,

61
00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.852
部分原因是我需要得到结果，
partly because I needed the end result,

62
00:03:03.852 --> 00:03:06.177
但更重要的原因是我享受编程。
but even more because I just enjoyed programming.

63
00:03:06.177 --> 00:03:10.575
这段旅程的终点，
So it was about the end of the journey,

64
00:03:10.575 --> 00:03:13.945
在25年后的今天，我们仍未达到。
which, 25 years later, we still have not reached.

65
00:03:13.945 --> 00:03:17.697
当年我只是想做一个完全属于自己的项目，
But it was really about the fact that I was looking for a project on my own

66
00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:21.987
我压根就没想过开源这件事。
and there was no open source, really, on my radar at all.

67
00:03:21.987 --> 00:03:24.668
但在那之后，
And what happened is ...

68
00:03:24.668 --> 00:03:30.551
随着项目越来越大，你会开始想让别人知道。
the project grows and becomes something you want to show off to people.

69
00:03:30.551 --> 00:03:34.829
感觉就像“哇，快来看看我的成果！”
Really, this is more of a, "Wow, look at what I did!"

70
00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.127
但说实话，最开始并没这么好。
And trust me -- it was not that great back then.

71
00:03:38.127 --> 00:03:40.032
我把它放到网上供人下载，
I made it publicly available,

72
00:03:40.032 --> 00:03:42.156
当时甚至还不是开源的。
and it wasn't even
open source at that point.

73
00:03:42.156 --> 00:03:47.375
当然，所有代码都是开放的，但我并没有想过
At that point it was source that was open, but there was no intention

74
00:03:47.375 --> 00:03:52.492
要用我们今天所熟知的开源方法
behind using the kind of open-source methodology that we think of today

75
00:03:52.492 --> 00:03:53.717
来改进它。
to improve it.

76
00:03:53.717 --> 00:03:54.862
我当时想的是，
It was more like,

77
00:03:54.862 --> 00:03:58.459
“看，这是我折腾了半年的成果，
"Look, I've been working on this for half a year,

78
00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.717
我想听听大家的意见。”
I'd love to have comments."

79
00:04:00.717 --> 00:04:03.217
有人来找过我。
And other people approached me.

80
00:04:03.217 --> 00:04:04.908
在赫尔辛基大学，
At the University of Helsinki,

81
00:04:04.908 --> 00:04:08.677
我有个朋友是做开源软件的——
I had a friend who was one of the open source --

82
00:04:08.677 --> 00:04:12.318
当年还叫“免费软件”——
it was called mainly "free software" back then --

83
00:04:12.318 --> 00:04:16.625
他让我了解到，“嘿，
and he actually introduced me to the notion that, hey,

84
00:04:16.625 --> 00:04:24.113
你可以用那些已有的开源许可证。”
you can use these open-source licenses that had been around.

85
00:04:24.113 --> 00:04:26.185
我考虑了一段时间。
And I thought about it for a while.

86
00:04:26.185 --> 00:04:29.699
我其实有点担心商业利益牵涉其中。
I was actually worried about the whole commercial interests coming in.

87
00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.208
我想，很多人一开始会跟我一样，
I mean, that's one of the worries I think most people who start out have,

88
00:04:34.208 --> 00:04:39.603
担心自己的工作成果会被人利用，不是吗？
is that they worry about somebody taking advantage of their work, right?

89
00:04:39.603 --> 00:04:43.740
于是我决定，“不管了。”
And I decided, "What the hell?"

90
00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.913
然后……
And --

91
00:04:44.913 --> 00:04:46.249
CA：然后某一天，
CA: And then at some point,

92
00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:48.733
一些人对你的代码提出了些建议，你觉得
someone contributed some code that you thought,

93
00:04:48.733 --> 00:04:51.617
“哇哦，真是不错，我都没想到这一点。
"Wow, that really is interesting, I would not have thought of that.

94
00:04:51.617 --> 00:04:53.226
对改进软件很有帮助。”
This could actually improve this."

95
00:04:53.226 --> 00:04:56.201
LT：其实最开始没有多少人直接改代码，
LT: It didn't even start by people contributing code,

96
00:04:56.201 --> 00:04:59.747
而是提出了很多想法。
it was more that people started contributing ideas.

97
00:04:59.747 --> 00:05:03.024
让别人看一下你所做的项目——
And just the fact that somebody else takes a look at your project --

98
00:05:03.024 --> 00:05:05.615
我想在其他行业也是这样——
and I'm sure it's true of other things, too,

99
00:05:05.615 --> 00:05:07.456
但在编程的时候就更是如此——
but it's definitely true in code --

100
00:05:07.456 --> 00:05:10.973
有人对你的代码感兴趣，
is that somebody else takes an interest in your code,

101
00:05:10.973 --> 00:05:13.536
仔细研究过，能给你反馈，
looks at it enough to actually give you feedback

102
00:05:13.536 --> 00:05:15.273
给你建议。
and give you ideas.

103
00:05:15.273 --> 00:05:17.163
对我而言是非常重要的一件事。
That was a huge thing for me.

104
00:05:17.163 --> 00:05:20.379
当时我21岁，还很年轻，
I was 21 at the time, so I was young,

105
00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:24.372
但在那之前，我人生的一半时间都在敲代码。
but I had already programmed for half my life, basically.

106
00:05:24.372 --> 00:05:28.374
之前的每一个项目，我都是独自完成的，
And every project before that had been completely personal

107
00:05:28.374 --> 00:05:31.524
有人开始评论我的代码，
and it was a revelation when people just started commenting,

108
00:05:31.524 --> 00:05:34.839
给予反馈，真是头一遭。
started giving feedback on your code.

109
00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:38.646
他们甚至还没开始改代码，
And even before they started giving code back,

110
00:05:38.646 --> 00:05:41.401
但对我来讲已经足以载入史册，因为我觉得，
that was, I think, one of the big moments where I said,

111
00:05:41.401 --> 00:05:43.288
“我爱世人！”
"I love other people!"

112
00:05:43.288 --> 00:05:44.629
别误会我，
Don't get me wrong --

113
00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:46.297
其实我并不合群。
I'm actually not a people person.

114
00:05:46.297 --> 00:05:49.526
（笑声）
(Laughter)

115
00:05:49.526 --> 00:05:52.081
我并不爱世人。
I don't really love other people --

116
00:05:52.081 --> 00:05:53.125
（笑声）
(Laughter)

117
00:05:53.125 --> 00:05:54.795
我爱电脑，
But I love computers,

118
00:05:54.795 --> 00:05:57.035
我喜欢通过发邮件互动，
I love interacting with other people on email,

119
00:05:57.035 --> 00:06:00.401
因为这样能给你缓冲。
because it kind of gives you that buffer.

120
00:06:00.401 --> 00:06:06.925
但我真正喜欢的是人们给出评论，参与我的项目。
But I do love other people who comment and get involved in my project.

121
00:06:06.925 --> 00:06:09.273
这样能让我的项目快速成长。
And it made it so much more.

122
00:06:09.273 --> 00:06:12.137
CA：有没有那样一个时间点，你发现自己一直在做的项目
CA: So was there a moment when you saw what was being built

123
00:06:12.137 --> 00:06:14.478
突然开始成型了，
and it suddenly started taking off,

124
00:06:14.478 --> 00:06:17.245
你对自己说，“等一下，这事儿也许能做成，
and you thought, "Wait a sec, this actually could be something huge,

125
00:06:17.245 --> 00:06:20.192
不单单是一个我能得到良好反馈的个人项目，
not just a personal project that I'm getting nice feedback on,

126
00:06:20.192 --> 00:06:25.821
而是能在整个科技界掀起轩然大波的大事”？
but a kind of explosive development in the whole technology world"?

127
00:06:25.821 --> 00:06:27.029
LT：还真没有。
LT: Not really.

128
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:30.605
对我而言，最重要的时刻并不是它变大的那一天，
I mean, the big point for me, really, was not when it was becoming huge,

129
00:06:30.605 --> 00:06:33.709
恰恰是在它还不够大的时候。
it was when it was becoming little.

130
00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:37.315
对我而言，当我不再独自工作，
The big point for me was not being alone

131
00:06:37.315 --> 00:06:40.997
有10个人，或者100个人加入进来——
and having 10, maybe 100 people being involved --

132
00:06:40.997 --> 00:06:42.509
这才是一种突破。
that was a big point.

133
00:06:42.509 --> 00:06:45.572
之后事情就顺其自然了。
Then everything else was very gradual.

134
00:06:45.572 --> 00:06:49.846
对我来说，从100人到100万人，并不是那么重要。
Going from 100 people to a million people is not a big deal -- to me.

135
00:06:49.846 --> 00:06:51.702
其实我的意思是，如果你……
Well, I mean, maybe it is if you're --

136
00:06:51.702 --> 00:06:52.728
（笑声）
(Laughter)

137
00:06:52.728 --> 00:06:55.519
如果你是想把自己的成果卖掉，那确实就很重要——
If you want to sell your result then it's a huge deal --

138
00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:56.644
别误解我的意思。
don't get me wrong.

139
00:06:56.644 --> 00:06:58.795
如果你感兴趣的是科技本身，
But if you're interested in the technology

140
00:06:58.795 --> 00:07:00.694
是这个项目本身，
and you're interested in the project,

141
00:07:00.694 --> 00:07:02.579
那么最重要的就是找到志趣相投的人。
the big part was getting the community.

142
00:07:02.579 --> 00:07:04.267
之后这个群体会自发壮大。
Then the community grew gradually.

143
00:07:04.267 --> 00:07:08.165
并没有一个特别明显的时间点，我会觉得
And there's actually not a single point where I went like,

144
00:07:08.165 --> 00:07:10.372
“哇哦，这事儿快成了！”因为——
"Wow, that just took off!" because it --

145
00:07:10.372 --> 00:07:13.730
这个时间非常漫长。
I mean -- it took a long time, relatively.

146
00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.720
CA：所有我采访的技术专家们都对你赞不绝口，
CA: So all the technologists that I talk to really credit you

147
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.687
说你极大改进了他们的工作。
with massively changing their work.

148
00:07:19.687 --> 00:07:21.264
不光是Linux，
And it's not just Linux,

149
00:07:21.264 --> 00:07:22.728
还有Git，
it's this thing called Git,

150
00:07:22.728 --> 00:07:26.771
是一种软件开发管理系统。
which is this management system for software development.

151
00:07:26.771 --> 00:07:30.480
简单介绍一下它以及你在其中扮演的角色。
Tell us briefly about that and your role in that.

152
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:32.300
LT：我们遇到的问题之一，
LT: So one of the issues we had,

153
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.415
（在项目开始后）一段时间后才开始显现，
and this took a while to start to appear,

154
00:07:35.415 --> 00:07:37.708
就是当你……
is when you ...

155
00:07:37.708 --> 00:07:43.064
从10个或者100个人参与一个项目，
When you grow from having 10 people or 100 people working on a project

156
00:07:43.064 --> 00:07:45.482
增长到1万人的时候，而这——
to having 10,000 people, which --

157
00:07:45.482 --> 00:07:48.966
关于（Linux）内核，我们碰到的问题是，
I mean, right now we're in the situation where just on the kernel,

158
00:07:48.966 --> 00:07:52.189
每次更新都有1000人参与，
we have 1,000 people involved in every single release

159
00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:56.336
而更新频率是每两、三个月一次。
and that's every two months, roughly two or three months.

160
00:07:56.336 --> 00:07:58.797
这其中有些人作用不大。
Some of those people don't do a lot.

161
00:07:58.797 --> 00:08:01.413
有很多人能做出小小的改进。
There's a lot of people who make small, small changes.

162
00:08:01.413 --> 00:08:03.658
但要进行维护，
But to maintain this,

163
00:08:03.658 --> 00:08:06.586
所需要的工作量就会大大增加。
the scale changes how you have to maintain it.

164
00:08:06.586 --> 00:08:10.713
我们吃尽了苦头。
And we went through a lot of pain.

165
00:08:10.713 --> 00:08:17.281
有时候甚至整个程序都仅仅是为了对源代码进行维护。
And there are whole projects that do only source-code maintenance.

166
00:08:17.281 --> 00:08:20.668
CVS曾经是最流行的，
CVS is the one that used to be the most commonly used,

167
00:08:20.668 --> 00:08:24.509
我恨透了它，连碰都不想碰，
and I hated CVS with a passion and refused to touch it

168
00:08:24.509 --> 00:08:27.605
我喜欢更基础、更有趣的方法，
and tried something else that was radical and interesting

169
00:08:27.605 --> 00:08:31.004
但其他人又不喜欢。
and everybody else hated.

170
00:08:31.004 --> 00:08:32.408
CA：（笑声）
CA: (Laughs)

171
00:08:32.408 --> 00:08:34.519
LT：我们陷入了僵局，
LT: And we were in this bad spot,

172
00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:37.370
成千上万的人想参与进来，
where we had thousands of people who wanted to participate,

173
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:42.426
但很多时候，我成为了那个断点，
but in many ways, I was the kind of break point,

174
00:08:42.426 --> 00:08:44.974
我无法让自己跨出那一步，
where I could not scale to the point

175
00:08:44.974 --> 00:08:47.807
同上千人合作。
where I could work with thousands of people.

176
00:08:47.807 --> 00:08:50.323
因此Git是我的第二个大项目，
So Git is my second big project,

177
00:08:50.323 --> 00:08:55.446
它存在的意义就是维护我的第一个大项目。
which was only created for me to maintain my first big project.

178
00:08:55.446 --> 00:08:57.710
事实上这就是我的工作方式。
And this is literally how I work.

179
00:08:57.710 --> 00:09:00.249
我编程并不是为了……
I don't code for --

180
00:09:00.249 --> 00:09:01.995
我编程是因为好玩，
well, I do code for fun --

181
00:09:01.995 --> 00:09:04.399
但我也想做一些有意义的事情，
but I want to code for something meaningful

182
00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:08.461
因此我设计每一个程序仅仅是因为我自己需要
so every single project I've ever done has been something I needed

183
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:09.860
而且……
and --

184
00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.317
CA：因此，实际上，Linux和Git的出现，
CA: So really, both Linux and Git kind of arose

185
00:09:13.317 --> 00:09:15.672
都是意外的收获，
almost as an unintended consequence

186
00:09:15.672 --> 00:09:17.866
仅仅因为你不想跟太多人一起工作。
of your desire not to have to work with too many people.

187
00:09:17.866 --> 00:09:19.557
LT：千真万确。没错。
LT: Absolutely. Yes.

188
00:09:19.557 --> 00:09:20.672
（笑声）
(Laughter)

189
00:09:20.672 --> 00:09:22.346
CA：太牛了。
LT：可不是吗。
CA: That's amazing.
LT: Yeah.

190
00:09:22.346 --> 00:09:23.851
（掌声）
(Applause)

191
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:27.256
你带来了技术革新，
And yet, you're the man who's transformed technology

192
00:09:27.256 --> 00:09:28.607
不是一次，而是两次，
not just once but twice,

193
00:09:28.607 --> 00:09:31.215
我们试图去探寻背后的原因。
and we have to try and understand why it is.

194
00:09:31.215 --> 00:09:32.923
你给了我们一些线索，但是……
You've given us some clues, but ...

195
00:09:32.923 --> 00:09:37.577
这是一张你小时候的照片，你手里拿着魔方。
Here's a picture of you as a kid, with a Rubik's Cube.

196
00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:41.721
你刚才提到，你从10岁、11岁就开始编程了，
You mentioned that you've been programming since you were like 10 or 11,

197
00:09:41.721 --> 00:09:43.120
人生的一半，
half your life.

198
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.980
你是那种电脑天才，技术宅吗？
Were you this sort of computer genius, you know, übernerd,

199
00:09:46.980 --> 00:09:49.384
你在学校里是无所不能的明星吗？
were you the star at school who could do everything?

200
00:09:49.384 --> 00:09:52.129
你是个什么样的孩子？
What were you like as a kid?

201
00:09:52.129 --> 00:09:54.673
LT：没错，我觉得自己就是宅男的原型。
LT: Yeah, I think I was the prototypical nerd.

202
00:09:54.673 --> 00:09:57.129
我是说，当年……
I mean, I was ...

203
00:09:57.129 --> 00:09:59.115
我并不喜欢跟人打交道。
I was not a people person back then.

204
00:09:59.115 --> 00:10:01.725
那是我弟弟。
That's my younger brother.

205
00:10:01.725 --> 00:10:04.530
显然我对魔方更有兴趣，
I was clearly more interested in the Rubik's Cube

206
00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.096
完全无视我弟弟。
than my younger brother.

207
00:10:06.096 --> 00:10:07.197
（笑声）
(Laughter)

208
00:10:07.197 --> 00:10:10.360
我还有个妹妹，她不在照片里，
My younger sister, who's not in the picture,

209
00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:12.798
当我们全家聚在一起的时候——
when we had family meetings --

210
00:10:12.798 --> 00:10:16.595
我家人不算多，但我有好几个侄子侄女——
and it's not a huge family, but I have, like, a couple of cousins --

211
00:10:16.595 --> 00:10:19.503
她会事先给我打预防针。
she would prep me beforehand.

212
00:10:19.503 --> 00:10:22.072
在我进屋之前，她会说，
Like, before I stepped into the room she would say,

213
00:10:22.072 --> 00:10:25.909
“好的，你要注意什么什么……”
"OK. That's so-and-so ..."

214
00:10:25.909 --> 00:10:28.283
因为我其实……
Because I was not --

215
00:10:28.283 --> 00:10:29.533
我是个技术宅。
I was a geek.

216
00:10:29.533 --> 00:10:30.706
我喜欢电脑，
I was into computers,

217
00:10:30.706 --> 00:10:31.916
喜欢数学，
I was into math,

218
00:10:31.916 --> 00:10:33.071
喜欢物理。
I was into physics.

219
00:10:33.071 --> 00:10:34.245
我擅长这些。
I was good at that.

220
00:10:34.245 --> 00:10:37.553
但也没到出类拔萃的地步。
I don't think I was particularly exceptional.

221
00:10:37.553 --> 00:10:39.995
就像我妹妹说的，
Apparently, my sister said

222
00:10:39.995 --> 00:10:47.620
我最突出的品质就是不放弃。
that my biggest exceptional quality was that I would not let go.

223
00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:50.205
CA：好的，那我们就来聊聊这个，
这很有意思。
CA: OK, so let's go there, because that's interesting.

224
00:10:50.205 --> 00:10:51.413
你不轻言放弃。
You would not let go.

225
00:10:51.413 --> 00:10:54.302
也就是说，不是因为技术宅或者聪明，
So that's not about being a geek and being smart,

226
00:10:54.302 --> 00:10:57.441
而是因为……固执？
that's about being ... stubborn?

227
00:10:57.441 --> 00:10:58.981
LT：没错，就是固执。
LT: That's about being stubborn.

228
00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:01.092
就像，
That's about, like,

229
00:11:01.092 --> 00:11:03.322
我开始做一件事情，
just starting something

230
00:11:03.322 --> 00:11:08.797
我不会说，“好的，我不干了， 我要去干点别的……
and not saying, "OK, I'm done, let's do something else --

231
00:11:08.797 --> 00:11:10.953
看，比如那个！”
Look: shiny!"

232
00:11:10.953 --> 00:11:15.470
我发现我在做其他事情的时候也会这样。
And I notice that in many other parts in my life, too.

233
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:18.750
我在硅谷生活了7年。
I lived in Silicon Valley for seven years.

234
00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:22.885
一直在同一家公司上班，那可是在硅谷哦，
And I worked for the same company, in Silicon Valley,

235
00:11:22.885 --> 00:11:24.653
从未换过。
for the whole time.

236
00:11:24.653 --> 00:11:27.203
这简直闻所未闻。
That is unheard of.

237
00:11:27.203 --> 00:11:29.010
尤其在硅谷这个地方。
That's not how Silicon Valley works.

238
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:32.604
硅谷最大的特点就是，人们总在跳槽，
The whole point of Silicon Valley is that people jump between jobs

239
00:11:32.604 --> 00:11:35.254
一会这一会那。
to kind of mix up the pot.

240
00:11:35.254 --> 00:11:37.168
而我不是这样。
And that's not the kind of person I am.

241
00:11:37.168 --> 00:11:39.754
CA：但在Linux系统发展的过程中，
CA: But during the actual development of Linux itself,

242
00:11:39.754 --> 00:11:44.445
这种固执有时会让你和别人产生冲突。
that stubbornness sometimes brought you in conflict with other people.

243
00:11:44.445 --> 00:11:46.139
给我们讲讲这个。
Talk about that a bit.

244
00:11:46.139 --> 00:11:51.706
维持已有成果的质量是不是非常必要？
Was that essential to sort of maintain the quality of what was being built?

245
00:11:51.706 --> 00:11:54.405
你会如何来形容之后发生的事情？
How would you describe what happened?

246
00:11:54.405 --> 00:11:57.239
LT：我不确定这是不是非常必要。
LT: I don't know if it's essential.

247
00:11:57.239 --> 00:12:00.433
还是说回到“我并不合群”这一点，
Going back to the "I'm not a people person," --

248
00:12:00.433 --> 00:12:04.100
有的时候我还……
sometimes I'm also ...

249
00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.663
可以说，
shall we say,

250
00:12:05.663 --> 00:12:11.226
不太理解他人的感受，
"myopic" when it comes to other people's feelings,

251
00:12:11.226 --> 00:12:14.995
经常会说话伤到别人。
and that sometimes makes you say things that hurt other people.

252
00:12:14.995 --> 00:12:18.777
对此我感到很抱歉。
And I'm not proud of that.

253
00:12:18.777 --> 00:12:19.924
（掌声）
(Applause)

254
00:12:19.924 --> 00:12:23.148
但与此同时，
But, at the same time, it's --

255
00:12:23.148 --> 00:12:28.995
有人告诉我，我应该友善一些。
I get people who tell me that I should be nice.

256
00:12:28.995 --> 00:12:32.504
然后我会跟他们说，可能你是友善，
And then when I try to explain to them that maybe you're nice,

257
00:12:32.504 --> 00:12:34.772
但你应该更加富有侵略性一些，
maybe you should be more aggressive,

258
00:12:34.772 --> 00:12:38.337
他们会把这个当成我的不友善。
they see that as me being not nice.

259
00:12:38.337 --> 00:12:40.466
（笑声）
(Laughter)

260
00:12:40.466 --> 00:12:42.673
我想说的是我们是不同的。
What I'm trying to say is we are different.

261
00:12:42.673 --> 00:12:44.491
我不是个合群的人，
I'm not a people person;

262
00:12:44.491 --> 00:12:46.638
对此我并不感到骄傲，
it's not something I'm particularly proud of,

263
00:12:46.638 --> 00:12:48.192
但这就是我。
but it's part of me.

264
00:12:48.192 --> 00:12:53.010
而我喜欢开源软件的一点就是，
And one of the things I really like about open source

265
00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:56.736
它能让形形色色的人在一起合作。
is it really allows different people to work together.

266
00:12:56.736 --> 00:12:58.479
我们不必相互喜欢——
We don't have to like each other --

267
00:12:58.479 --> 00:13:00.711
有时候我们甚至互相讨厌。
and sometimes we really don't like each other.

268
00:13:00.711 --> 00:13:04.243
是真的，我们经常吵得不可开交。
Really -- I mean, there are very, very heated arguments.

269
00:13:04.243 --> 00:13:08.326
但是你会，你会发现许多事情——
But you can, actually, you can find things that --

270
00:13:08.326 --> 00:13:10.604
甚至都没法同意保留不同意见，
you don't even agree to disagree,

271
00:13:10.604 --> 00:13:13.653
因为大家的兴趣点真的不一样。
it's just that you're interested in really different things.

272
00:13:13.653 --> 00:13:16.581
回到我刚才说过的，
And coming back to the point where I said earlier

273
00:13:16.581 --> 00:13:20.908
我担心商人们利用我们的劳动成果，
that I was afraid of commercial people taking advantage of your work,

274
00:13:20.908 --> 00:13:23.530
但没过多久，我发现，
it turned out, and very quickly turned out,

275
00:13:23.530 --> 00:13:26.510
这些商人都是非常非常好的人。
that those commercial people were lovely, lovely people.

276
00:13:26.510 --> 00:13:30.235
他们做那些我不感兴趣的事，
And they did all the things that I was not at all interested in doing,

277
00:13:30.235 --> 00:13:32.331
关注点与我完全不同。
and they had completely different goals.

278
00:13:32.331 --> 00:13:37.668
他们使用开源软件的方法跟我不一样的。
And they used open source in ways that I just did not want to go.

279
00:13:37.668 --> 00:13:39.955
但正因为是开源的，他们可以这么干，
But because it was open source they could do it,

280
00:13:39.955 --> 00:13:42.325
而且实际上效果很好。
and it actually works really beautifully together.

281
00:13:42.325 --> 00:13:44.379
我甚至认为跟我使用的效果一样好。
And I actually think it works the same way.

282
00:13:44.379 --> 00:13:47.658
我们需要合群的人，需要能与人交流的人，
You need to have the people-people, the communicators,

283
00:13:47.658 --> 00:13:49.168
需要温暖友好的人
the warm and friendly people

284
00:13:49.168 --> 00:13:50.804
就像……
who like --

285
00:13:50.804 --> 00:13:52.280
（笑声）
(Laughter)

286
00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:55.355
喜欢拥抱你，带你走进这个圈子。
really want to hug you and get you into the community.

287
00:13:55.355 --> 00:13:56.950
但不是每个人都能做到。
But that's not everybody.

288
00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:58.395
比如我就做不到。
And that's not me.

289
00:13:58.395 --> 00:13:59.876
我关注的是技术。
I care about the technology.

290
00:13:59.876 --> 00:14:01.792
有的人关注用户界面。
There are people who care about the UI.

291
00:14:01.792 --> 00:14:04.885
我死也做不来用户界面。
I can't do UI to save my life.

292
00:14:04.885 --> 00:14:07.921
举个例子，如果我被困在一个孤岛上，
I mean, if I was stranded on an island

293
00:14:07.921 --> 00:14:11.345
逃出生天的唯一办法是设计一个漂亮的用户界面，
and the only way to get off that island was the make a pretty UI,

294
00:14:11.345 --> 00:14:12.591
我宁愿死在岛上。
I'd die there.

295
00:14:12.591 --> 00:14:13.736
（笑声）
(Laughter)

296
00:14:13.736 --> 00:14:15.870
人跟人是不一样的，
So there's different kinds of people,

297
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.778
我并不是在找借口，只是想解释给大家听。
and I'm not making excuses, I'm trying to explain.

298
00:14:18.778 --> 00:14:20.363
CA：我们上周见面的时候，
CA: Now, when we talked last week,

299
00:14:20.363 --> 00:14:23.038
你聊到自己的一些其他特点，
you talked about some other trait that you have,

300
00:14:23.038 --> 00:14:24.572
我觉得很有意思。
which I found really interesting.

301
00:14:24.572 --> 00:14:25.854
是关于品味的。
It's this idea called taste.

302
00:14:25.854 --> 00:14:28.355
我这里有一些图片。
And I've just got a couple of images here.

303
00:14:28.355 --> 00:14:33.197
我觉得这一段代码就没什么品位，
I think this is an example of not particularly good taste in code,

304
00:14:33.197 --> 00:14:35.451
而这一段要好一些，
and this one is better taste,

305
00:14:35.451 --> 00:14:37.548
相信大家一看便知。
which one can immediately see.

306
00:14:37.548 --> 00:14:40.639
这两段代码有什么不一样？
What is the difference between these two?

307
00:14:40.639 --> 00:14:41.921
LT：这是……
LT: So this is --

308
00:14:41.921 --> 00:14:45.671
在座的有哪些人编过程？
How many people here actually have coded?

309
00:14:45.671 --> 00:14:47.221
CA：我的天啊。
CA: Oh my goodness.

310
00:14:47.221 --> 00:14:48.399
LT：我敢保证，
LT: So I guarantee you,

311
00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:49.969
刚刚举手的每一位，
everybody who raised their hand,

312
00:14:49.969 --> 00:14:52.614
肯定做过单向链表。
they have done what's called a singly-linked list.

313
00:14:52.614 --> 00:14:55.115
它是在……
And it's taught --

314
00:14:55.115 --> 00:14:58.735
这个，第一段不怎么漂亮的代码，
This, the first not very good taste approach,

315
00:14:58.735 --> 00:15:02.826
基本上是在你刚开始学编程的时候学到的。
is basically how it's taught to be done when you start out coding.

316
00:15:02.826 --> 00:15:04.894
你不需要真的理解这段代码。
And you don't have to understand the code.

317
00:15:04.894 --> 00:15:06.969
我觉得最有意思的
The most interesting part to me

318
00:15:06.969 --> 00:15:10.932
是最后一个“if”语句。
is the last if statement.

319
00:15:10.932 --> 00:15:13.232
因为在单向链表中——
Because what happens in a singly-linked list --

320
00:15:13.232 --> 00:15:16.907
这里是试图将一个已存在的入口移出链表——
this is trying to remove an existing entry from a list --

321
00:15:16.907 --> 00:15:20.763
不同之处在于这是第一个入口
and there's a difference between if it's the first entry

322
00:15:20.763 --> 00:15:22.785
还是一个位于中间的入口。
or whether it's an entry in the middle.

323
00:15:22.785 --> 00:15:24.434
如果是第一个入口，
Because if it's the first entry,

324
00:15:24.434 --> 00:15:27.455
你需要将指针改向第一个入口。
you have to change the pointer to the first entry.

325
00:15:27.455 --> 00:15:28.697
而如果位于中间，
If it's in the middle,

326
00:15:28.697 --> 00:15:31.142
你需要将指针改向上一个入口。
you have to change the pointer of a previous entry.

327
00:15:31.142 --> 00:15:33.169
这是两种完全不同的情况。
So they're two completely different cases.

328
00:15:33.169 --> 00:15:34.346
CA：这一个比较好。
CA: And that's better.

329
00:15:34.346 --> 00:15:35.941
LT：这一个比较好。
LT: And this is better.

330
00:15:35.941 --> 00:15:38.643
它没有if语句。
It does not have the if statement.

331
00:15:38.643 --> 00:15:40.889
这完全不影响——
And it doesn't really matter --

332
00:15:40.889 --> 00:15:44.105
你不必了解这里为什么没有“if”语句，
I don't want you understand why it doesn't have the if statement,

333
00:15:44.105 --> 00:15:45.480
你需要了解的是
but I want you to understand

334
00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.129
有时候你可以换个角度看问题，
that sometimes you can see a problem in a different way

335
00:15:48.129 --> 00:15:51.498
重写代码，排除特例，
and rewrite it so that a special case goes away

336
00:15:51.498 --> 00:15:53.399
完美覆盖所有情况。
and becomes the normal case.

337
00:15:53.399 --> 00:15:55.327
这就是好的代码。
And that's good code.

338
00:15:55.327 --> 00:15:56.908
同时也很简单。
But this is simple code.

339
00:15:56.908 --> 00:15:58.301
这是最基本的原则。
This is CS 101.

340
00:15:58.301 --> 00:16:01.798
其实这都不重要——
当然，细节非常重要。
This is not important -- although, details are important.

341
00:16:01.798 --> 00:16:05.905
对我来说，我愿意与之共事的人，
To me, the sign of people I really want to work with

342
00:16:05.905 --> 00:16:09.294
必须有好的品位，这就是如何……
is that they have good taste, which is how ...

343
00:16:09.294 --> 00:16:10.951
我举的这个例子很傻，
I sent you this stupid example

344
00:16:10.951 --> 00:16:13.743
没什么意义，因为实在太短。
that is not relevant because it's too small.

345
00:16:13.743 --> 00:16:15.924
好的品位体现在更长的代码里。
Good taste is much bigger than this.

346
00:16:15.924 --> 00:16:19.960
好的品位体现在能看清全局
Good taste is about really seeing the big patterns

347
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:24.451
甚至有一种直觉，知道怎么把事情做漂亮。
and kind of instinctively knowing what's the right way to do things.

348
00:16:24.451 --> 00:16:27.735
CA：好的，让我们来总结一下。
CA: OK, so we're putting the pieces together here now.

349
00:16:27.735 --> 00:16:30.057
你有品位，
You have taste,

350
00:16:30.057 --> 00:16:32.423
当然是对于程序员们而言，
in a way that's meaningful to software people.

351
00:16:32.423 --> 00:16:33.609
你很有品位——
You're --

352
00:16:33.609 --> 00:16:35.432
（笑声）
(Laughter)

353
00:16:35.432 --> 00:16:39.966
LT：对在座有些人而言，是这样。
LT: I think it was meaningful to some people here.

354
00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:42.913
CA：你是个非常有才华的电脑程序员，
CA: You're a very smart computer coder,

355
00:16:42.913 --> 00:16:45.621
你异常固执。
and you're hellish stubborn.

356
00:16:45.621 --> 00:16:46.902
但肯定不止这些。
But there must be something else.

357
00:16:46.902 --> 00:16:48.538
因为你是改变了未来的人。
I mean, you've changed the future.

358
00:16:48.538 --> 00:16:51.375
你一定有实现未来宏伟愿景的能力。
You must have the ability of these grand visions of the future.

359
00:16:51.375 --> 00:16:53.177
你是个有远见的人，是吗？
You're a visionary, right?

360
00:16:53.177 --> 00:16:55.792
LT：其实在过去两天里，我在TED大会
LT: I've actually felt slightly uncomfortable at TED

361
00:16:55.792 --> 00:16:57.966
觉得不太自在 ，
for the last two days,

362
00:16:57.966 --> 00:17:00.575
因为有很多关于未来的想象，对吧？
because there's a lot of vision going on, right?

363
00:17:00.575 --> 00:17:02.296
我并不是一个有远见的人。
And I am not a visionary.

364
00:17:02.296 --> 00:17:04.548
我没有制定未来五年的计划。
I do not have a five-year plan.

365
00:17:04.548 --> 00:17:05.931
我是一名工程师。
I'm an engineer.

366
00:17:05.931 --> 00:17:07.234
而且我觉得，真是——
And I think it's really --

367
00:17:07.234 --> 00:17:09.551
我是说——我非常乐意跟梦想家在一起
I mean -- I'm perfectly happy with all the people

368
00:17:09.551 --> 00:17:12.343
他们行走四方，仰望苍穹，
who are walking around and just staring at the clouds

369
00:17:12.343 --> 00:17:15.208
看着满天星辰说，“我想到那儿去。”
and looking at the stars and saying, "I want to go there."

370
00:17:15.208 --> 00:17:16.733
但我是低头看路的那种人，
But I'm looking at the ground,

371
00:17:16.733 --> 00:17:19.583
我只想填好眼前这个坑，
and I want to fix the pothole that's right in front of me

372
00:17:19.583 --> 00:17:21.047
不让自己掉进去。
before I fall in.

373
00:17:21.047 --> 00:17:22.589
我是这样的人。
This is the kind of person I am.

374
00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:23.724
（欢呼）
(Cheers)

375
00:17:23.724 --> 00:17:25.060
（掌声）
(Applause)

376
00:17:25.060 --> 00:17:29.357
CA：上周你跟我聊过他们俩。
CA: So you spoke to me last week about these two guys.

377
00:17:29.357 --> 00:17:32.239
他们是谁？你跟他们有什么关系？
Who are they and how do you relate to them?

378
00:17:32.239 --> 00:17:35.881
LT：这其实是技术界的一个老故事了，
LT: Well, so this is kind of cliché in technology,

379
00:17:35.881 --> 00:17:37.912
特斯拉和爱迪生之争，
the whole Tesla versus Edison,

380
00:17:37.912 --> 00:17:42.866
特斯拉被认为是一名有远见的科学家，总是有疯狂的想法。
where Tesla is seen as the visionary scientist and crazy idea man.

381
00:17:42.866 --> 00:17:45.692
大家都爱特斯拉。
And people love Tesla.

382
00:17:45.692 --> 00:17:48.693
你看，还有人把自己公司也叫这个名字。
I mean, there are people who name their companies after him.

383
00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:51.365
（笑声）
(Laughter)

384
00:17:51.365 --> 00:17:54.017
另一个人是爱迪生，
The other person there is Edison,

385
00:17:54.017 --> 00:17:57.577
经常被嘲讽说他是一个单调乏味的人，
who is actually often vilified for being kind of pedestrian

386
00:17:57.577 --> 00:17:59.522
而且——
and is --

387
00:17:59.522 --> 00:18:02.259
他最有名的一句话就是，
I mean, his most famous quote is,

388
00:18:02.259 --> 00:18:07.396
“天才是1%的灵感加上99%的汗水。”
"Genius is one percent inspiration and 99 percent perspiration."

389
00:18:07.396 --> 00:18:08.906
而我是爱迪生一派的，
And I'm in the Edison camp,

390
00:18:08.906 --> 00:18:11.115
尽管人们经常讨厌他。
even if people don't always like him.

391
00:18:11.115 --> 00:18:14.137
如果你比较一下这两位，
Because if you actually compare the two,

392
00:18:14.137 --> 00:18:18.704
特斯拉很能抓眼球，
Tesla has kind of this mind grab these days,

393
00:18:18.704 --> 00:18:21.853
但真正改变世界的是谁？
but who actually changed the world?

394
00:18:21.853 --> 00:18:25.315
爱迪生也许不是个讨喜的人，
Edison may not have been a nice person,

395
00:18:25.315 --> 00:18:28.431
但他做了很多事——
he did a lot of things --

396
00:18:28.431 --> 00:18:30.884
他也许没那么天才，
he was maybe not so intellectual,

397
00:18:30.884 --> 00:18:34.355
不是那么有远见。
not so visionary.

398
00:18:34.355 --> 00:18:37.670
我觉得自己更像爱迪生而不是特斯拉。
But I think I'm more of an Edison than a Tesla.

399
00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:40.136
CA：TED大会这一周的主题是梦想——
CA: So our theme at TED this week is dreams --

400
00:18:40.136 --> 00:18:41.508
宏伟、大胆的梦想。
big, bold, audacious dreams.

401
00:18:41.508 --> 00:18:43.344
而你却像碎梦人。
You're really the antidote to that.

402
00:18:43.344 --> 00:18:45.461
LT：我会试着收敛一些。
LT: I'm trying to dial it down a bit, yes.

403
00:18:45.461 --> 00:18:46.642
CA：太好了。
CA: That's good.

404
00:18:46.642 --> 00:18:47.746
（笑声）
(Laughter)

405
00:18:47.746 --> 00:18:51.046
我们接受你，我们爱你。
We embrace you, we embrace you.

406
00:18:51.046 --> 00:18:53.825
谷歌和其他许多公司使用你的软件，
Companies like Google and many others have made, arguably,

407
00:18:53.825 --> 00:18:56.055
挣了非常多的钱。
like, billions of dollars out of your software.

408
00:18:56.055 --> 00:18:57.240
你会觉得不爽吗？
Does that piss you off?

409
00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:58.434
LT：不会。
LT: No.

410
00:18:58.434 --> 00:19:01.063
原因有很多，
No, it doesn't piss me off for several reasons.

411
00:19:01.063 --> 00:19:03.116
其中一个原因是，我过得不错。
And one of them is, I'm doing fine.

412
00:19:03.116 --> 00:19:04.942
真心不错。
I'm really doing fine.

413
00:19:04.942 --> 00:19:06.566
另一个原因就是——
But the other reason is --

414
00:19:06.566 --> 00:19:11.916
如果我不将它开源，而过于纠结的话，
I mean, without doing the whole open source and really letting go thing,

415
00:19:11.916 --> 00:19:14.151
Linux就不会发展成今天这样。
Linux would never have been what it is.

416
00:19:14.151 --> 00:19:19.277
而且Linux让我有了许多经历，尽管我不喜欢，比如在公开场合讲话，
And it's brought experiences I don't really enjoy, public talking,

417
00:19:19.277 --> 00:19:21.481
但同时，这也是一种历练。
but at the same time, this is an experience.

418
00:19:21.481 --> 00:19:23.238
相信我。
Trust me.

419
00:19:23.238 --> 00:19:28.411
很多事情让我成为了一个快乐的人，
So there's a lot of things going on that make me a very happy man

420
00:19:28.411 --> 00:19:30.973
我觉得当初的选择没有错。
and thinking I did the right choices.

421
00:19:30.973 --> 00:19:32.950
CA：开源软件这个想法——
CA: Is the open source idea --

422
00:19:32.950 --> 00:19:34.579
我想这是最后一个话题——
this is, I think we'll end here --

423
00:19:34.579 --> 00:19:38.647
开源软件这个想法已经在全世界实现了吗？
is the open source idea fully realized now in the world,

424
00:19:38.647 --> 00:19:41.690
还是说还有潜力可挖，
or is there more that it could go,

425
00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:44.738
还有很多可以做的？
are there more things that it could do?

426
00:19:44.738 --> 00:19:47.001
LT：我有两个想法。
LT: So, I'm of two minds there.

427
00:19:47.001 --> 00:19:51.511
我认为开源软件如此成功的原因之一
I think one reason open source works so well in code

428
00:19:51.511 --> 00:19:53.944
在于归根结底，
is that at the end of the day,

429
00:19:53.944 --> 00:19:57.214
代码是一个非黑即白的事情。
code tends to be somewhat black and white.

430
00:19:57.214 --> 00:20:01.395
我们有非常明确的方法来分辨，
There's often a fairly good way to decide,

431
00:20:01.395 --> 00:20:05.385
一段代码是行还是不行。
this is done correctly and this is not done well.

432
00:20:05.385 --> 00:20:07.768
代码要么运行成功，要么失败，
Code either works or it doesn't,

433
00:20:07.768 --> 00:20:12.394
这就意味着没什么可争议的。
which means that there's less room for arguments.

434
00:20:12.394 --> 00:20:16.055
我们有很多争议，不是吗？
And we have arguments despite this, right?

435
00:20:16.055 --> 00:20:18.023
在其他许多领域——
In many other areas --

436
00:20:18.023 --> 00:20:21.759
人们探讨过公开政治和其他类似的事情——
I mean, people have talked about open politics and things like that --

437
00:20:21.759 --> 00:20:24.731
有时候真的很难去说，
and it's really hard sometimes to say

438
00:20:24.731 --> 00:20:28.512
没错，你可以在其他领域也采取同样的原则，
that, yes, you can apply the same principles in some other areas

439
00:20:28.512 --> 00:20:33.986
因为在那些地方不是非黑即白的，有灰色，
just because the black and white turns into not just gray,

440
00:20:33.986 --> 00:20:36.343
也有其他颜色。
but different colors.

441
00:20:36.343 --> 00:20:40.714
因此，科学界的开源显然是一种回归。
So, obviously open source in science is making a comeback.

442
00:20:40.714 --> 00:20:42.393
科学最初是开源的。
Science was there first.

443
00:20:42.393 --> 00:20:45.084
但之后变得越来越封闭，
But then science ended up being pretty closed,

444
00:20:45.084 --> 00:20:48.751
只存在那些昂贵的科学期刊上。
with very expensive journals and some of that going on.

445
00:20:48.751 --> 00:20:52.586
开源让科学回归了，
And open source is making a comeback in science,

446
00:20:52.586 --> 00:20:59.261
我们有了arXiv和开放期刊。
with things like arXiv and open journals.

447
00:20:59.261 --> 00:21:01.244
维基百科也改变了世界。
Wikipedia changed the world, too.

448
00:21:01.244 --> 00:21:02.782
还有其他许多例子，
So there are other examples,

449
00:21:02.782 --> 00:21:05.660
我觉得未来还会有更多。
I'm sure there are more to come.

450
00:21:05.660 --> 00:21:07.277
CA：但你不是个有远见的人，
CA: But you're not a visionary,

451
00:21:07.277 --> 00:21:09.243
这些事跟你没啥关系。
and so it's not up to you to name them.

452
00:21:09.243 --> 00:21:10.416
LT：当然。
LT: No.

453
00:21:10.416 --> 00:21:11.499
（笑声）
(Laughter)

454
00:21:11.499 --> 00:21:13.487
得靠你们去实现了，对吗？
It's up to you guys to make them, right?

455
00:21:13.487 --> 00:21:14.784
CA：没错。
CA: Exactly.

456
00:21:14.784 --> 00:21:15.945
林纳斯·托瓦兹，
Linus Torvalds,

457
00:21:15.945 --> 00:21:18.275
谢谢你的Linux，谢谢你为互联网做的一切，
thank you for Linux, thank you for the Internet,

458
00:21:18.275 --> 00:21:20.057
谢谢你为安卓手机做的一切。
thank you for all those Android phones.

459
00:21:20.057 --> 00:21:23.068
谢谢你来参加TED大会，让我们更加了解你。
Thank you for coming here to TED and revealing so much of yourself.

460
00:21:23.068 --> 00:21:24.510
LT：谢谢。
LT: Thank you.

461
00:21:24.510 --> 00:21:26.722
（掌声）
(Applause)
